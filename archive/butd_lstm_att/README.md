# Bottom-up and top-down attention 

## Bottom-up attention
- The paper proposes the use of object detection model as a means to perform feature extraction. This is sort of like a form of hard attention 
- The original paper uses Faster R-CNN with ResNet 101 backbone pretrained on Visual Genome as the object detector feature extractor. This will be our baseline for bottom-up attention
